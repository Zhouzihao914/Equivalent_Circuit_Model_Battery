This archive includes files necessary to simulate an electric vehicle. It 
contains four drive-cycle files (where the first column is time (s), and the
second column is desired speed (mph)) and MATLAB files to set up and run
simulations. In particular,

- setupSimVehicle.m: Used by simVehicle.m to simulate the EV.
- simVehicle.m:      Main code to run simulation of EV.
- hwfet.txt:         Highway drive cycle
- nycc.txt:          New-York city cycle
- udds.txt:          Urban dynamometer drive cycle
- us06.txt:          US highway 6 drive cycle
